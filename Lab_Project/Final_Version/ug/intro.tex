\section{Introduction}

The Basys2 Figure~\ref{fig:Basys2}, board is a circuit design and implementation platform that anyone can use to gain experience building real digital circuits. Built around a Xilinx Spartan-3E Field Programmable Gate Array and a Atmel AT90USB2 USB controller, the Basys2 board provides complete, ready-to-use hardware suitable for hosting circuits ranging from basic logic devices to complex controllers.

Our project uses the Basys2 to make a clock with some features. We propose to use the 7 segment display as an output and the push buttons as input, to set the time and navigate through the menus.
