\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

By the end of this project, there was a better understanding of all the components used in the making of this clock, as well as an understanding on to how better use FPGAs in a project, using the provided datasheet to analyze what could or could not be done and how to use the provided peripherals.

There were some dificulties, some of them due to the lack of knowledge of the verilog programming language, others due to lack of debugging, simulating and testing. In the end, the proposed project was not completed in its entirety, due to said difficulties and pinpointing the correct cause of the observed problems we faced.
